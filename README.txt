I couldnt put some stuff I use from another people in the main screen cause they couldnt fit in screen.
Thanks to:
	-Noel Berry for sharing updateAssets.vbs.
	-Ricardo Tanaka cause I use some techniques he code in other game we make together.
	-The creator of http://www.bfxr.net/ cause I use it for create some quickly Sound Effects.
	-La Gringa for beeing my inspiration, she has a Facebook account and  is very loved by my schoolmates, 
	this is her Facebook account: https://www.facebook.com/gringa.fisi .

A little explanation:
	La Gringa is sleeping after many disturbs happend in the faculty she lives in.
	She dreams a nightmare where she is scaping from the Aliens that confuse her by a Cow for experiments.
	The Worst thing is she needs to eat very quickly or she will die... and also has to avoid that kinda
	trunk mecha saw.
	
	You must help her scaping or waking up from this Nightmare!
